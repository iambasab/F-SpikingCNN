This repository contains the python code to run the spiking convolutional network with bio-inspired neural filters for two datasets:

1) The MNIST digit recognition dataset
2) A subset of the Caltech dataset placed in the caltech_subset folder.

The following libraries need to be installed other than the basic libraries like numpy, scipy etc. to run the colaboratory notebooks:

Nengo, Nengo-dl, Pillow, Skimage

The outputs plots from the network are stored as .png images in the results folder.
